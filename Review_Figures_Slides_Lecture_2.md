### Data
1. 1. [X] The type of the graphic is adapted to the nature of data (curve, bars, pie, histogram, cloud...) ;
2. 2. [X] Approximations/interpolation make sense ;
3. 3. [X] Curves are defined by a sufficient number of points ;
4. 4. [X] The building method of the curve is clear : interpolation (linear, polynomial,regression...) ;
5. 5. [X] Confidence intervals are visualized (or given separately) ;
6. 6. [X] Steps of histograms are adequate ;
7. 7. [ ] Histograms visualize probabilities (from 0 to 1).
### Graphical objects
1. 1. [X] Graphical objects are readable on screen, on printed version (B/W), on video... ;
2. 2. [X] Graphic range is standard, without too similar colors, without green (video) ;
3. 3. [X] Graphical axis are well identified and labelled ;
4. 4. [X] Scales and units are explicits ;
5. 5. [X] Curves cross without ambiguity ;
6. 6. [ ] Grids help the reader.
### Annotations
1. 1. [X] Axis are labelled by quantities ;
2. 2. [X] Labels of the axis are clear, and self contained ;
3. 3. [ ] Units are indicated on the axis ;
4. 4. [X] Axes are oriented from the left to the right and from the bottom to the top ;
5. 5. [ ] Origin is (0, 0), if not it should be clearly justified ;
6. 6. [X] No hole on the axes.
7. 7. [ ] For bar graphs/histograms order of bars is based on classical ordering (alphabetical, temporal, from the best to the worse) are better than a random order ;
8. 8. [ ] Each curve has a legend ;
9. 9. [X] Each bar has a legend ;
### Information
1. 1. [X] Curves are on the same scale ;
2. 2. [ ] The number of curves on a same graph is small (less than 6) ;
3. 3. [X] Compare curves on a same graphic ;
4. 4. [ ] A curve cannot be removed without reducing the information ;
5. 5. [X] The graphic gives a relevant information to the reader ;
6. 6. [ ] If the vertical axis shows averages, it should indicates error bars ;
7. 7. [ ] It is not possible to remove any objet without modifying the readability of the graphic.
### Context
1. 1. [ ] All the symbols are defined and referenced in the text ;
2. 2. [X] The graphic produces more information than any other representation (choice of the variable) ;
3. 3. [X] The graphic has a title ;
4. 4. [X] The title is sufficiently self contained to partially understand the graphic ;
5. 5. [ ] The graphic is referenced in the text ;
6. 6. [ ] The text comment the figure.

7. [ ] **Last but not least : The graphical representation should be elegant**
