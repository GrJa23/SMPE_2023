3. 3. [X] Register on the Mattermost through this invitation link. This is the preferred communication mode.
4. 4. [X] Set up a public github or gitlab project for this lecture. You will take notes on this lecture and turn your homework and computational documents in this project.
5. 5. [X] Register to the MOOC on Reproducible Research
6. 6. [X] Follow modules 1 + 2 of the MOOC with as much exercises as possible (except the last one of module2, on Challenger; watching interviews is optional)
7. 7. [X] Set up a computational document system (e.g., Rstudio or Jupyter on your laptop or through the UGA JupyterHub).
8. 8. [X] Report the URL of your git project, your mattermost ID on the Pad.

### Homework Week 2
1. 1. [X] Start learning R by reading this R crash course for computer scientists (Rmd sources).
2. 2. [X] Criticize every figure of Jean-Marc’s slides by:
    - Applying the checklist for good graphics;
    - Proposing a better representation (hand-drawing is fine) that passes the checklist.
3. 3. [X] Report this work for at least 3 figures on you github/gitlab project.
4. 4. [X] MOOC: Complete exercise 5 of module 2 (Challenger). Write a short text explaining what is good and wrong about this document (you may want to provide an updated version of the notebook) and upload on your github/gitlab space *[goto](https://github.com/GrJa23/SMPE_2023/blob/main/Exercises/Exercises_Mooc/Module2/module2_exo5_exo5_fr-_inc_review_in_En_GJ.ipynb)*

4. 4. [X] Here is an opportunity to practice your data curation/analysis skills by producing the First name/last name analysis in a computational document. I encourage you to use dplyr and ggplot for this analysis - Initial version shared. Further updates are going to be made *[goto - pdf]https://github.com/GrJa23/SMPE_2023/blob/main/Exercises/Exercices_Others/20231108_Names-Methodo2022-exercise_Updated_GJ_Shared_V1.pdf* *[goto - Rmd]https://github.com/GrJa23/SMPE_2023/blob/main/Exercises/Exercices_Others/20231108_Names-Methodo2022-exercise_Updated_GJ_Shared_V1.Rmd*
