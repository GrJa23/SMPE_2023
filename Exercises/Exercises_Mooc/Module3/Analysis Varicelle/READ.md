This section contains the database and the file used for to generate the analysis on the chickenpox in France.
The aim was to use the work done for the influenza-like illness and reproduce a similar analysis. 

I did update it locall on my laptop in addition to the gitlab used during the MOOC.

1. Dowloaded the file locally from sentiweb.fr
2. Adjusted the analysis and in the notebook
3. Update all files in Gitlab and Github
