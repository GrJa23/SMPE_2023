This section contains the database and the file used for to generate the analysis on the influenza in France.
The aim was to download the database and to make sure that the notebook file used for the analysis was able to access the data locally.

I did update it locall on my laptop in addition to the gitlab used during the MOOC.

1. Dowloaded the file locally
2. Loaded the file in MOOC
3. Import OS into the notebook and used os.chdir(os.getcwd()) to get access to the "local" URL
4. The code is executing perfectly
