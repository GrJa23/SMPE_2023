# Passport for Open Science - a practical guide for PhD Students

Using open science is supported at the highest level ion tyhe European Union. It is expected to get it applied especially when the research is funded by public institutions/funds.
This guide is made to help future researchers/teams to discuss this topic and the possiblity to apply it.


## 1. Planning an open approach to scientific work
### Using freely accessible resources
Contains explanations and examples of accessible resources.
"WORTH KNOWING
The fact that a resource is in open access is not a guarantee of quality in itself. It needs to be critically evaluated before being used like all documentary resources."\
https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/
### Planning data management
"Research data are defined as factual records (numerical scores, textual records, images and sounds) used as primary sources for scientific research, and that are commonly accepted in the scientific community as necessary to validate research findings." (source: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development - OECD)

Steps:
1. Creating a Data Management Plan (DMP): Required for example by the French National Research Agency (ANR).
2. Data Management life cycle:\
    a. Collecting\
    b. Describing\
    c. Storing\
    d. Processing/Analysing\
    e. Archiving\
    f. Making Data Available

### Working in a reproducible way: For yourself, for others

WORTH KNOWING
Reproducibility of research does not on its own guarantee the quality of
research work. Methods are a core issue in the debate about reproducibility.
It is important that researchers come to an agreement on common data
analysis methods which go further than explanations provided in the methodological sections of articles.""

a. Manage your bibliographical\
b. Organise data, files and folders\
c. Learn the basics of version control\ 
d. Automate certain recurring tasks\
e. Automate processing and workflows\
f. Document code and data\
g. Opt for open-source solutions

## 2. Disseminating research
### Disseminating your publications in open access
Open access dissemination involves the immediate, free and permanent availability of scientific publications on the Internet.
List of journals in which articles can be published with the price:\
https://doaj.org/

Depositing in an open archive allows to disseminate a scientific work whether it has been published or not.

Publishers may set an embargo period during which this is restricted but the law limits this embargo to 6 months for articles in science, technology and medicine and 12 months for articles in the humanities and social sciences.

### Making your thesis freely accessible

Steps for depositing and disseminating:\
a. Defend the thesis
b. Make all requested corrections and have the thesis approved
c. Submit the final version of the thesis and sign the dissemination contract
d. The university library takes care of processing and disseminating thesis. It can also be deposited in an open archive.

### Making research data open
The French Law for a Digital Republic assimilates research data with public data. Research data are now included "by default" in the principle of open data just like data produced by the French civil service. In principle, research data must be published on the Internet and made freely reusable.

Respect of the fair principle:
- Findable
- Accessible
- Interoperable
- Reusable


## 3. Preparing for after your thesis, join the movement
### Deeply rooted public policies
### Evaluating research differently
Peer review is a prerequisite for any publication and a guarantee of the reliability
of scientific results.

## Sources 
Include all sources and credits.

# The state of Open Data 2023

Licences, references and data are available

Conditions over the participants and how the survey has been run are provided.
6091 (out of o a total of 7042 answers) have been used.

## Key takeaways from the survey
- Support is not making its way to those who need it
- One size does not fit all
- Challenging stereotypes
- Credit is an ongoing issue
- AI awareness hasn’t translated to action

High level analysis with graph are shown and commented.

## More detailed analysis:
### Analysis to action

The big challenges in promoting the publication of open
academic data remain the same: Credit and concerns.
Graham Smith talks more about these concerns in his key
insights piece: ‘Beyond policy, meeting researchers’ practical
needs’. We may also be seeing some fatigue in enthusiasm
for open research in general as open data policies come
into place and researchers find themselves with even less
time to comply with the directives of their funders. 54% of
respondents felt that funders should make sharing research
data part of their requirements for awarding grants. In 2022,
52% agreed – slightly less. However, this proportion has
dropped from 2019, where 69% agreed.

=> some other explanations can be given on why such results are showns including the fact that the profile of the participants might have change in between the survey in 2019 and in 2023.

What areas, if any, do you feel you need help
with in regard to making your research data
openly available?

=> highlight the reasons why researchers might be hesitant in going to open data. There is a need to reinsure the right protection vs Copyright/licensing of Data.

### Key insights: Beyond policy
Result of the survey show that collecting all the data in order to share it is not a consistant practive (around 20% are doing it for all) though 80%+ are sharing the "relevant" datas.

Some institutions/countries are reluctant in sharing their data for mulitple reasons (legal blockers/data privacy)
"A lack of clarity about copyright and data
licensing was significantly more likely to be a concern for
technicians/research assistants (45%)"

Expectations to get a national mandates are not expected in the same way accross different countries.

Making data publicly available
89% of respondents make their data available publicly, with
11% having responded, ‘I do not share my data beyond my
immediate collaborators’ (n=6091).
=> this result is showing that most of the participant of the survey are already in an "open data" process.

Do researchers receive enough credit for sharing
their data?
=> the answer to this question is showing how important this element is:
1. driving the researchers to share their data
2. a blocking point in getting more data shared 

### Optimism and Concerns

Motivations for data sharing by publication year
=> the reference to the 1st year publication is here to help provide an insight on expectations based on the level of experience/carrer progression expectations but more cross factors (i.e country, role) would be expected to be taken into account to be able to get a more insightful analysis.

### The importance of data management plans

The awareness about te DMP is increasing versus previous years to be at 52% though there are some variability dependings in the subject of expertise.

### AI and open science

This section is showing the positive use of LLM in being able to analyze a huge amount of available large data.

### Recommendations

Following the analysis made, action requests are suggested to the relevant actors. Good insights with practical actions suggested.


Useful insight:
Both documents are providing good complimentary information as one document, the passeport (1), provide all the definitions and expectations from the french regulation and the other document (2) is providing broader international view based on a survey completed by practitionners.
The document (1) is sharing links and praticle exemples that help to get starting with "open science". 

Any questions that are coming after going through the 2 documents:
- What are the regulations in the regions accross the world?
- How rights/copyrights are protected when it the information is open?

Biases to be considered for each documents:
(1):\
    -  The aim of the document is to "sell" the use of Open Science without taking into account the limitations that arise when using it\
    - It is presented as a "must be used" practice\
(2):\
    - Is the panel representing significantly the overall population/users?\
    - What would be the point of view from industries vs institutions?\
